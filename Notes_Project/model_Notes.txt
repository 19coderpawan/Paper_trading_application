The werkzeug.security module is a built-in security utility provided by Werkzeug, which is a core dependency of Flask.
🔐 What is werkzeug.security?
It is a submodule of Werkzeug, and it provides simple and secure functions for:
->Hashing passwords
->Verifying hashed passwords
These are essential for any Flask application that handles user authentication.

1. generate_password_hash(password)
Purpose: Securely hashes a plain-text password.

Usage:

from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash

hash = generate_password_hash("mysecretpassword")
Behind the scenes: It uses PBKDF2, a strong hashing algorithm, with a salt and multiple iterations.

2. check_password_hash(hash, password)
Purpose: Verifies whether the entered password matches the stored hash.

Usage:
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash

check_password_hash(hash, "mysecretpassword")  # Returns True or False
