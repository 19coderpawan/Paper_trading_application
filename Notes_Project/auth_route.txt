****from flask import Blueprint, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash****

Blueprint: Allows you to organize routes into components. Here, all authentication routes are grouped under auth.
render_template: Renders HTML templates (like login.html, register.html).
redirect: Redirects the user to a new route after an action.
url_for: Dynamically builds the URL for a route by its function name.
flash: Displays one-time messages to the user (e.g., "Logged in successfully").

🧠 What flash() actually does:
It adds a message to the session (temporarily).
You can then access and display it in your template using get_flashed_messages().
The first argument is the message to be flashed, and the second argument ('success') is the category of the message.

🔍 What is a flash category?
The category helps you style or filter messages in your HTML templates.
Common categories include:
'success' ✅ — for green success messages
'error' ❌ — for red error messages
'warning' ⚠️ — for yellow warning messages
'info' ℹ️ — for blue or neutral messages



***from flask_login import login_user, logout_user, login_required***
login_user(user): Logs in the given user.
logout_user(): Logs the current user out.
login_required: Decorator to protect routes — only accessible if user is logged in.
