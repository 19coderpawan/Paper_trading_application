üóÇ What is instance/config.py?
The config.py file in the instance/ folder is responsible for:
-->Loading the .env file using load_dotenv()
-->Making the values available to the Flask app config via a Config class

How does the config class is  used in your main app?
In your app.py, you write:

from instance.config import Config
...
app.config.from_object(Config)
‚û° This tells Flask: ‚ÄúHey, load all your settings from the Config class we defined.‚Äù
