from flask import Flask
✅ What it does:
Imports the core Flask class from the Flask library.
You'll use this to create your Flask app instance.


from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
✅ What it does:
Imports SQLAlchemy, the Flask extension that integrates SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask.


from instance.config import Config
✅ What it does:
Imports the Config class from instance/config.py.
This class (as discussed earlier) loads sensitive config like SECRET_KEY, database URI, etc. — usually using .env.

db = SQLAlchemy()
✅ What it does:
Creates a SQLAlchemy object — not tied to any app yet.


def create_app():
✅ What it does:
Defines a function that creates and configures your Flask app.
This is useful for separating app creation and configuration, especially for testing, modularity, or multiple environments.


    app = Flask(__name__)
✅ What it does:
Creates the actual Flask application instance.
__name__ helps Flask locate your templates and static files.

    app.config.from_object(Config)
✅ What it does:
Loads configuration from the imported Config class (from instance/config.py).

This sets values like:
SECRET_KEY
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI


    db.init_app(app)
✅ What it does:
Initializes the SQLAlchemy extension with your Flask app.

This binds the earlier db = SQLAlchemy() object to the app.


    from models import User, Trade
✅ What it does:
Imports your models after db is initialized.
This ensures that models use the correct db context.


    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
✅ What it does:
Creates the tables in your database only if they don’t exist already.
app.app_context() sets the current app context (needed when working outside a route).
db.create_all() creates the schema from the models.


    from routes import main
✅ What it does:
Imports the main Blueprint from routes.py or routes/__init__.py.

Using Blueprints is a good practice for organizing routes cleanly, especially in larger apps.

    app.register_blueprint(main)
✅ What it does:
Registers the main blueprint so that the routes defined in it are available to the app.


    return app
✅ What it does:
Returns the fully created and configured Flask app.

 Summary of What Happens
When create_app() is called:
->A Flask app is created.
->Config is loaded (including from .env).
->Database is initialized.
->Tables (User, Trade) are created if missing.
->Routes are registered using a blueprint.
->Final app is returned.
->This pattern is powerful and used by production-ready Flask apps.
